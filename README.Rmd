**PCRSimPlot** is an R package for simulating and plotting PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) data. It includes functions for generating PCR data from specified parameters and visualizing the results.


## Installation

You can install the development version of **PCRSimPlot** from [GitHub](https://Attalowe.github.io/PCRSimPlot/).

```{r message=FALSE}
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Attalowe/PCRSimPlot")
library(PCRSimPlot)
```

## Overview of the functions in {PCRSimPlot}

* `simulate_pcr()`: simulates PCR data based on initial DNA concentration (`N0`), amplification efficiency (`E`), and a fluorescence threshold (`threshold`).
The function returns a `list` with two elements:

1. *pcr_data*: A data frame containing the simulated PCR data with columns Cycle, DNA, and Fluorescence.
2. *Ct*: The cycle threshold (Ct) value at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold.

### Example

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
result <- simulate_pcr(N0 = 10, E = 1.8, threshold = 10000)
head(result$pcr_data)
print(result$Ct)
```



* `plot_pcr()`
Plots the simulated PCR data, showing fluorescence over cycles and the cycle threshold (Ct).
# Usage

```r
plot_pcr(pcr_data, Ct)
```

Arguments:

pcr_data: A data frame containing the PCR data (typically from simulate_pcr()).
Ct: The cycle threshold (Ct) value.
Returns:

A ggplot object visualizing the PCR data with a line plot of fluorescence over cycles, including a vertical line indicating the Ct valu


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, warning=FALSE}

result <- simulate_pcr(N0 = 10, E = 1.8)
plot <- plot_pcr(result$pcr_data, result$Ct)
print(plot)

```

### Lifecycle

This package is currently an *experimental*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that it is
functional, but interfaces and functionalities may change over time, testing and documentation may be lacking.
